# CongressForms
A RESTful API for retrieving the required fields for and filling out the contact forms of members of the US Congress.
This project relies on [Contact Congress](https://github.com/unitedstates/contact-congress) as the data source for congress member forms.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Hainish/congress-forms.png)](http://travis-ci.org/Hainish/congress-forms)

## Installation and Setup

### The easy way (for developers)

#### Requirements

 - `apt-get install vagrant virtualbox`

#### Installation

 - `vagrant up local`
 - `vim config/congress-forms_config.rb # edit settings here`

#### Running

 - `vagrant ssh local`
 - `cd /vagrant`
 - `bundle exec rackup`

### The hard way (or when running in production)

#### Requirements

 - `apt-get install imagemagick libmysql++-dev libpq-dev git libqt4-dev`
 - Download and install the latest phantomjs from http://phantomjs.org/

#### Installation

 - `apt-get install ruby`

or [install ruby with rvm](http://rvm.io).

 - `gem install bundler`
 - `bundle install`

Create the database, then

 - `cp config/database-example.rb config/database.rb`
 - `vim config/database.rb # fill in db info`
 - `cp config/congress-forms_config.rb.example config/congress-forms_config.rb`
 - `bundle exec rake ar:create ar:schema:load`

#### Populating the database

Clone a copy of the contact-congress and store it somewhere:

 - `git clone https://github.com/unitedstates/contact-congress`

Then cd back over to congress-forms and run

 - `bundle exec rake congress-forms:map_forms[contact_congress_directory]`

replacing `contact_congress_directory` with the path where you cloned the `contact-congress` project.

#### Running

Just run `rackup`

## Testing

If you haven't set up the test db, create it, then

 - `vim config/database.rb # fill in the test db info`

Create and prepare the test database:

 - `PADRINO_ENV=test bundle exec rake ar:create ar:schema:load`

And run

 - `bundle exec rspec spec`

## Usage

The application has three endpoints to post to:

### `/retrieve-form-elements`

Provide a json object containing an array of [`bio_ids`](http://bioguide.congress.gov/) in string format.  Responds with a json object containing the necessary fields for the congressional contact forms.

Example:

    $ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"bio_ids": ["C000880", "A000360"]}' http://localhost:9292/retrieve-form-elements
    {"C000880":{"required_actions":[{"maxlength":null,"value":"$NAME_FIRST","options_hash":null},{"maxlength":null,"value":"$NAME_LAST","options_hash":null},{"maxlength":null,"value":"$ADDRESS_STREET","options_hash":null},{"maxlength":null,"value":"$ADDRESS_CITY","options_hash":null},{"maxlength":null,"value":"$ADDRESS_ZIP5","options_hash":null},{"maxlength":null,"value":"$EMAIL","options_hash":null},{"maxlength":null,"value":"$SUBJECT","options_hash":null},{"maxlength":null,"value":"$MESSAGE","options_hash":null},{"maxlength":null,"value":"$NAME_PREFIX","options_hash":{" Mr. ":"Mr."," Mrs. ":"Mrs."," Ms. ":"Ms."," Mr. and Mrs. ":"Mr. and Mrs."," MSgt ":"MSgt"," Dr. ":"Dr."," Reverend ":"Reverend"," Sister ":"Sister"," Pastor ":"Pastor"," The Honorable ":"The Honorable"," Representative ":"Representative"," Senator ":"Senator"}},{"maxlength":null,"value":"$ADDRESS_STATE_POSTAL_ABBREV","options_hash":"US_STATES_AND_TERRITORIES"},{"maxlength":null,"value":"$TOPIC","options_hash":{"Agriculture":"AG","Banking & Credit":"BN","Budget & Taxes":"BU","Business, Commerce & Labor":"CM","Congress":"CG","Federal & Postal Employees":"CS","Education, Science & Technology":"ED","Energy":"EN","Environment, Nat.

### `/fill-out-form`

Provide a json object containing the `bio_id` of the member of congress, the `fields` to fill out, a `campaign_tag` for tracking successes, and a unique `uid` that will have to be provided if a subsequent captcha request is required.  Responds with a json object containing a status: `success` if the request succeeded, `error` if there was a problem, or `captcha_needed` if the form requires a captcha to be filled out.  If `error` there will be an additional message giving more information.  If `captcha_needed` a url will be provided which gives a relative path to the captcha image that can be provided to the end user.

Example #1, with captcha:

    $ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"bio_id": "A000000", "uid": "example_uid", "fields": {"$NAME_FIRST": "John", "$NAME_LAST": "Doe", "$ADDRESS_STREET": "123 Main Street", "$ADDRESS_CITY": "New York", "$ADDRESS_ZIP5": "10112", "$EMAIL": "joe@example.com", "$MESSAGE": "I have concerns about the proposal....", "$NAME_PREFIX": "Grand Moff"}}' http://localhost:9292/fill-out-form
    {"status":"captcha_needed","url":"/captchas/e410e577123c5e19a526ad3f6b.png"}

Example #2, no captcha:

    $ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"bio_id": "A111111", "campaign_tag": "stop_sopa", "uid": "example_uid_2", "fields": {"$NAME_FIRST": "John", "$NAME_LAST": "Doe", "$ADDRESS_STREET": "123 Main Street", "$ADDRESS_CITY": "New York", "$ADDRESS_ZIP5": "10112", "$EMAIL": "joe@example.com", "$MESSAGE": "I have concerns about the proposal....", "$NAME_PREFIX": "Grand Moff"}}' http://localhost:9292/fill-out-form
    {"status":"success"}

### `/fill-out-captcha`

For continuing filling in the remote form when a captcha is present.  Provide a json object containing the same `uid` you provided in the previous request to `/fill-out-captcha`, as well as the captcha answer in the `answer` string.  As above, responds with a javascript object containing the status `success` or `error`.

Example for #1 above:

    $ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"answer": "cx9bp", "uid": "example_uid"}' http://localhost:9292/fill-out-captcha
    {"status":"success"}

## Status Indications and Helpers

The application has a number of other helpful endpoints to indicate status and failures:

### `/recent-fill-image/<bio_id>`

Provide a `bio_id` as part of the GET request.  Responds with a 302 redirect to a badge indicating the status of form fills since the last time the congress member actions were udated.

### `/recent-fill-status/<bio_id>`

Provide a `bio_id` as part of the GET request.  Responds with a hash giving statistics on the number of successes, failures, and errors encountered when trying to fill in forms since the last time the congress member actions were updated.

### `/recent-statuses-detailed/<bio_id>`

Provide a `bio_id` as part of the GET request.  Responds with a detailed list of recent statuses when trying to fill in the form for this congress member.  'Recent' means since the last time this congress member has been updated with new success criteria or actions.  This endpoint is only accessable if a valid `debug_key` is provided as a parameter.

### `/list-actions/<bio_id>`

Provide a `bio_id` as part of the GET request.  Responds with a detailed list of all actions that are performed to fill out the form for this congress member.  This endpoint is only accessable if a valid `debug_key` is provided as a parameter.

### `/list-congress-members`

Responds with a list of all congress members and their websites.  This endpoint is only accessable if a valid `debug_key` is provided as a parameter.
